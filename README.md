# Tuition Reimbursement Management System (TRMS)

## Project Description
The Tuition Reimbursement Management System (TRMS) is designed to allow employees to submit requests for tuition reimbursement for a variety of events. After an event form is submitted, it is reviewed by the employee's direct supervisor, the department head, and the benefits coordinator(benco). After the benco has approved the event, it is approved, but pending. Once the event has completed, the employee must either give a presentation or submit grade paperwork as proof. Presentations are confirmed by the direct supervisor, and grades are confirmed by the benco. Once the proof documentation has been confirmed, the tuition is awarded to the employee.
