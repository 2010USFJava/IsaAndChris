Tuition Reimbursement Management System (TRMS)

Overview:
	- Purpose of TRMS: provide a system that encourages quality knownledge growth relevant to an individual's expertise.
	- Current System provides reimbursements for:
		- university courses, seminars, ceritication preparation classes, certifications, and technical training.
	- Current System relies solely on:
		- email communication, requiring manual lookups of available funds and it error-prone due to inbox clutter
		and incorrect routing of tasks
	- Currently, there is no way to record and report on reimbursements awarded so the company has no way to indentify
	hightly-invested courses that could be developed to be offered in-house.

Business Rules:
	- Employee:
		- each employee is allowed to claim up to $1000 in tuition reimbursement a year ($1000 per year)
		- the amount available to an employee is reset on the new year (January 1st)
		- Event Types have different standard reimbursement coverage:
			- University Courses 80%
			- Seminars 60%
			- Cerification Preparation Classes 75%
			- Cerification 100%
			- Technical Training 90%
			- Other 30%
	- After a BenCo has approved a reimbursement, the reimbursement is pending until a passing grade or presentation
	over the event is provided.
	- The monetary amount available for an employee to reimburse is definded by the following equation:
		AvailableReimbursement = TotalReimbursement($1000) - PendingReimbursements - AwardedReimbursements
	- If the projected reimbursement for an event exceeds the available reimbursement amount, it is adjusted to the amount available
	- Reimbursements DO NOT cover course materials such as books

Complete the Tuition Reimbursement Form:
	- All Employees must complete the Tuition Reimbursement Form one week prior to the start of the event
	- This form must collect (required):
		- basic employee information
		- date, time, location
		- description
		- cost
		- grading format
		- type of event
		- work-related justification (not sure what that looks like)
	- Employee can optionally include:
		- event-related attachments of pdf, png, jpeg, txt, or doc file type
		- attachments of approvals already provided of .msg (Outlook Email File) file type
		- type of approval - work time that will be missed
	- The projected reimbursement should be provided as a read-only field (encapsulation?)

Business Rules:	
	- Grading formats are pulled from a reference table
	- Certain grading formats require the employee to perform a presentation to management after the event's completion 
	and prior to awarded reimbursement
		- A passing grade is needed for reimbursement otherwise
	- Employee must provide the passing grade cutoff for the course, or choose to use a default passing grade if unknown
	- If an employee provides an approval email - that approval step is skipped (cannot skip BenCo approval)
	- If the course is less than (<) 2 weeks from beginning - the request is marked as urgent

Direct Supervisor Approval:
	- The direct supervisor must provide approval for Tuition Reimbursement.
	- The direct supervisor can request additional infromation from the employee before approval
Business Rules:
	- If denied, the direct supervisor must provide a reason
	- If the direct supervisor is also a department head, then the department head approval is skipped
	- If the direct supervisor does not complete this task in a timely matter, the request is auto-approved

Department Head Approval:
	- The department head must provide approval for Tuition Reimbursement
	- The deparment head can request additional information from the employee or direct supervisor before approval

	- This stage is not skippable for any reason
	- The benefits coordinator can request additional information from the employee, direct supervisor or department head
	before approval
	- The benefits coordinator has the ability to alter the reimbursement amount
Business Rules:
	- If the benefits coordinator changes the reimbursement amount, the employee should be notified and given the option 
	to cancel the request
	- If the benefits coordinator does not approve in a timely matter, an escalation email should be sent to the benefit 
	coordinator's direct supervisor
	- The benefits coordinator is allowed to award an amount larger than the amount available for the employee
	- The benefits coordinator must provide reason for this, and the reimbursement must be marked as "exceeding available funds for 
	reporting purposes"

Grade/Presentation Upload
	- Upon completion of the event:
		- the employee should attach either the Grade or Presentation as appropiate
	- After upload of a grade:
		- the benefits coordinator must confirm that the grade is passing
	- After upload of a presentation:
		- the direct manager must confirm that the presentation was satisfactory and presented to the appropriate parties
	- Upon confirmation:
		- the amount is awarded to the requestor
